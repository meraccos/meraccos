Hi there, I am Meraj!  
I am currently focusing on reinforcement learning and and its application on robotics, especially in the context of UAVs.  
I enjoy seeing how statistics and rigorous math actually work and give awesome results once poured into my code.  
Feel free to reach out if you want to work together or discuss any of my repos!
